The following is the brief explanning of the Script Submmited
--------------------
1. First Step:
We install and load the package Dplyr, it would help to clean our data before the analysis
2. Second Step:
We proceed to read all the data from the file, all the data are txt. We save the data in a individual variable
(all lowercases)
3. Third Step:
Merge the data, as we were told in the instructions of the assignment 
we use the function rbind (to combine the rows) and cbind the columns as well.
4. Fouth Step:
We change the variable names for others that describe better its value.
5. Finally
We summarise all the dataframe and lastly, write a txt file with the new information.
